As he was walking, he tripped and fell, causing his stomach to burst open and all the modaks to spill out. The moon, who was watching, laughed at him. Angered by the moon's arrogance, Ganesha cursed the moon, saying that anyone who saw the moon on this day would be subject to false accusations. The curse was later softened, stating that one could look at the moon a second time to negate the effects."

When Lord Shiva returned and was stopped by Ganesha, who didn't recognize him, Shiva in anger cut off the boy's head. Seeing Parvati's grief, Shiva promised to replace the head with that of the first living being he found, which was an elephant. Thus, Ganesha got his elephant head and was blessed to be worshipped first before any other deity."
